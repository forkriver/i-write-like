# I Write Like...

Incorporate [IWL.me](https://iwl.me) data into your WordPress posts, pages, and custom post types.

## Usage

* Clone the plugin into your WordPress Plugin folder (usually `wp-content/plugins`): `git clone https://github.com/forkriver/i-write-like`
* Activate the plugin
* Use the **Settings Â» I Write Like** panel to set your Client ID (per [@iwritelike](https://twitter.com/iwritelike)'s [tweet](https://twitter.com/iwritelike/status/699323892121341954), please use `3` or `4`)
* Edit your post, page, or custom post. The IWL data should be added when you save it.

Note: The data is currently cached to limit the load on IWL's servers. Future development will allow this cache to be updated periodically.
